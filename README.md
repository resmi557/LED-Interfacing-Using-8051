# LED-Interfacing-Using-8051

## Aim:
To interface an LED with the 8051 microcontroller and control its operation.

## Apparatus Required:
•	Laptop with Keil uVision software
•	Proteus Design Suite

## Circuit Diagram Setup in Proteus:
1.	Open Proteus and create a new project.
2.	Add the following components from the library:
o	8051 Microcontroller (AT89C51)
o	LED
o	Resistor (330Ω)
o	Ground (GND) connection
3.	Connect the LED's anode to P1.0 of the microcontroller through a 330Ω resistor.
4.	Connect the cathode of the LED to GND.
5.	Save the design and proceed to programming in Keil.

## Algorithm:
1.	Configure P1.0 as an output port.
2.	Set P1.0 HIGH to turn ON the LED.
3.	Introduce a delay.
4.	Set P1.0 LOW to turn OFF the LED.
5.	Introduce a delay.
6.	Repeat the process continuously.


## Program:
```
#include<reg51.h>
void main(){
	unsigned char x,y;
	unsigned int i;
	P1=0x00;
	while(1){
		x=0x01;
		for(y=0;y<8;y++){
			P1=x;
			for(i=0;i<60000;i++);
			x=x<<1;
		}
	}
}
```

## Output:

## Result:
The LED interfacing with the 8051 microcontroller has been successfully implemented and simulated using Keil and Proteus.
